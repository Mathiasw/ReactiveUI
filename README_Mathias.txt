So this is the attempt to create the REAL ReactiveUI at version 4.6.4 from the ORIGINAL repository.

It will only - as far as I can see - build under VS2012. So you'll need that for a start!

The file FicxTLSNugetIssue.reg was an attempt to fix the problems with Nuget on this system being SO OLD that it cannot get a TLS connecxtion tpo NuGet. It doesn't work in Wappiong and it;'s not going to work in LBG either.
